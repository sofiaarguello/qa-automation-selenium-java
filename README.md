# E2E Automation Framework | Selenium WebDriver & Java

This repository features a robust test automation framework designed for high-quality web application validation. Built with **Java** and **Selenium**, it demonstrates a professional approach to end-to-end (E2E) testing using industry-standard design patterns.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Language:** Java [cite: 9, 14]
* [cite_start]**Automation Tool:** Selenium WebDriver [cite: 7, 14, 16]
* [cite_start]**Test Runner:** TestNG [cite: 8]
* [cite_start]**Build Tool:** Maven [cite: 11]
* **Reporting:** TestNG Reports / Extent Reports
* [cite_start]**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions [cite: 10]

## 🏗️ Architecture: Page Object Model (POM)
The project is structured using the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern to ensure:
* **Maintainability:** UI changes only require updates in one place.
* **Reusability:** Page methods can be shared across multiple test cases.
* **Readability:** Clean separation between test logic and page-specific locators.

## 🧪 Key Test Scenarios
* **User Authentication:** Validating login/logout flows and error message handling.
* [cite_start]**E2E Purchase Flow:** From product selection to checkout completion[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Regression Suite:** Automated execution of 150+ functional test cases[cite: 19].
* **Data Validation:** Ensuring UI consistency with backend expectations.

## 📈 Impact & Results
* [cite_start]**Efficiency:** Reduced manual execution time by **40%** through critical flow automation[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Quality:** Decreased production defects by **30%** via early validation in the development lifecycle[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Integration:** Fully integrated with **CI/CD pipelines** for automated execution on every Pull Request[cite: 10, 17].
